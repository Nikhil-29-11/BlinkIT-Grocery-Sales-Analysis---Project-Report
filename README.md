## BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of the BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analysis project is to uncover valuable business insights from BlinkIT's grocery sales data using tools such as Power BI, SQL, Python, and Excel. The primary focus is to analyze overall sales performance, evaluate outlet performance based on size and geographic location, and identify both high-performing and underperforming product categories. Additionally, the project aims to understand customer preferences, such as fat content choices and item types, to support data-driven decision-making. Through comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, the goal is to provide actionable recommendations that can help optimize sales strategies, improve inventory planning, and enhance customer satisfaction.
